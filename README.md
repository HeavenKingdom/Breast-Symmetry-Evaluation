# Breast-Symmetry-Evaluation
**This project is a breast symmetry judgment evaluation application for Android system**

If you want to experience the complete function, you need to use it with [BSE-API](https://github.com/Montana-TestOrg/BSE-API)

,you need to use Gradle to build the application and use the physical machine to experience

**Specific steps**:

1. Clone the Breast-Symmetry-Evaluation project and configure the build environment.

2. Enable BSE-API before startup.

3. Connect the physical machine for USB debugging

**Working principle**:

This project realizes the judgment and evaluation of breast symmetry by taking photos or  selecting photos from albums and uploading them to the BSE server. For the specific implementation process of the algorithm, please move to the BSE-API project.

**Special Note**:

- Requires Gradle 7.2 and above to build.

- It is recommended to use the Android API 29 system to run this application.
